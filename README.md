I successfully conducted an HR Analytics study, analyzing 1,480 employee records to uncover insights on attrition, performance, and engagement. Key areas included turnover trends, salary analysis, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. I developed Power BI dashboards, enabling HR leaders to enhance retention strategies and workforce planning.
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides key insights into employee attrition, demographics, job roles, and compensation trends. The total employee count is 1,416, with 229 employees having left the company, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.17%. The average employee age is 37 years, the average salary is $6.5K, and the average tenure is 7 years.

Attrition Analysis by Education
The highest attrition is observed in employees with a Life Sciences background (38.43%), followed by those in Medical fields (24.89%). Marketing (14.85%) and Technical Degrees (13.97%) contribute moderately, while employees with other educational backgrounds (4.8%) experience the least attrition. These trends may indicate that employees in specialized fields are either finding better opportunities elsewhere or facing job dissatisfaction.

Attrition by Age
The 26-35 age group experiences the highest attrition (111 employees), making up nearly half of all departures. The 18-25 age group (43 employees) and 36-45 age group (41 employees) follow, while attrition among older employees (46-55: 26 employees, 55+: 8 employees) is significantly lower. Younger professionals might be seeking better career progression, while older employees tend to have higher job stability.

Gender-Based Attrition
Males: 145 employees
Females: 84 employees
The data suggests a higher attrition rate among male employees, which could be influenced by job role distribution, work-life balance factors, or industry dynamics.
Attrition by Salary Slab
Attrition is highly concentrated in the lower salary brackets:

Up to $5K: 158 employees
$5K-$10K: 48 employees
$10K-$15K: 18 employees
$15K+: 5 employees
This suggests that compensation plays a crucial role in retention, and higher salaries may correlate with improved employee retention.

Attrition by Years at Company
Employees with 1 year of experience have the highest attrition (57 employees), indicating a possible struggle with onboarding, culture fit, or early career growth.
Attrition stabilizes after the second year but spikes at year 5 (20 employees) and year 10 (16 employees), likely reflecting career stagnation or employees moving on to higher roles elsewhere.
Attrition by Job Role
Laboratory Technicians (60 employees) have the highest attrition, followed by Sales Executives (55 employees) and Research Scientists (44 employees).
Sales Representatives (33 employees) also experience notable attrition.
Other job roles exhibit lower attrition rates, possibly indicating more job satisfaction or career stability in those fields.
Attrition by Job Role & Department
A more detailed breakdown reveals:

Sales Executives and Representatives have high attrition, suggesting challenges in sales roles, such as pressure, target fulfillment, or external opportunities.
Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists also exhibit high attrition, which may be linked to job satisfaction, workload, or industry demand for skilled professionals.
Strategic Recommendations
Retention Programs: Targeted initiatives for 26-35 age group employees, such as career development plans, mentorship programs, and employee engagement activities, can reduce attrition.
Compensation Review: Since the majority of attrition is in the low-salary bracket, salary adjustments and performance-based incentives may improve retention.
Enhanced Onboarding: High attrition in the first year indicates a need for a stronger onboarding process, better integration, and support systems to retain new hires.
Career Growth Plans: Employees leaving at the 5-year and 10-year marks may require clearer career progression paths, leadership development programs, and new challenges.
Department-Specific Strategies: Addressing job-specific challenges in sales, laboratory, and research roles through better work conditions, incentives, and professional development opportunities can reduce turnover.
This HR Analytics Dashboard provides critical insights for improving employee retention, refining HR strategies, and enhancing organizational stability.
