# HR_Analytics
I successfully conducted an HR Analytics study, analyzing 1,480 employee records to uncover insights on attrition, performance, and engagement. Key areas included turnover trends, salary analysis, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. I developed Power BI dashboards, enabling HR leaders to enhance retention strategies and workforce planning.
